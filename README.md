# ALA
ALA is an environment protocol language that will be able to produce a file system environment based on the specification given from an end user.

## What problem will this solve?
I have always found myself remaking certain environments when I am developing something or getting a new computer. What if I could have a file and compiler that could make that for me? What if, like Tony Stark, I was able to have an artificial intelligence create its own environments to perform code in? A programming environment protocol language that could operate off behaviours might be able to better allow an AI to help understand file structure more efficiently than IO. In short, there are an array of problems that this language aims to solve, but I primarily hope it will make my development workflow better.

## What will user interaction look like?
Typically, interactions will involve a user creating a file following the general syntax of the ALA programming language, placing the .ala file as an argument to the compiler’s executable file (./ala), and pressing enter to allow the program to execute. After execution, the program will either return an error showing where a conversion or system error occurred, or it will return an environment within the user's linux system.

## How will the program take input?
An executable (./ala) will take an argument to where that file with a (.ala) is located as input.

## Structure of .ala file
There are two main portions of a .ala file. The Struct section of the progam is for build the standard folder tree structure within you linux enviorment. The main section is for code that will transform your struct system to produce a final enviroment that will be made in your system.

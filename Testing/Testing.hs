    Programming Languages Final Projec: ALA Compiler

    Description:
        ALA is an environment protocol language that will be able to produce a file system environment based 
        on the specification given from an end user. Typically, interactions will involve a user creating a file 
        following the general syntax of the ALA programming language, placing the .ala file as an argument to the 
        compilerâ€™s executable file (./ala), and pressing enter to allow the program to execute. After execution, 
        the program will either return an error showing where a conversion or system error occurred, or it will 
        return an environment within the user's linux system.

{- 
    Description:
        This section holds all of factors that contribute the other two follwing section being sucessful.
        Everything that is needed by the other two section is made and maintainted here.

    Subsections:
        Module Declaration:
            This is to call the module as main
        Imports:
            This is where all of the import are located
        Root Protion:
            This is were all of the root elements are located (String of the root and if there can be a overwrite)
        Protocal Protion:
            The element that make up a individual Protocal (Name, Priory, Passing calls, and a compact individual instance).
        Block Protion:
            All of the types that my us the differnet types of blocks (Name and Var to Child and Elements).
        Blocks Datatype:
            All of the data types that a block can be.
        Tokens Datatype: 
            All of the token that can come from lexing.

----[Functions Section]------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{-
    Description:
        This section houses all of the fuctions that contribute to the main convertion of the strings to all the 
        data structures that are used within this project. 

    Subsection:
        Lexer: 
            This function convert a string to an array of tokens.
        MakeBlocks:
            Converts an array of token into an array of blocks and forwards. [Block] Forward (->).
        FindAll (Folder Oriented):
            Takes a block, array of blocks, and return an array of all the instances. (Big helper method)
        DetermineRoot:
            Looks for the single instance of Root (Uses FindAll) and set it to the Root term for the entire program.
        Consolidate:
            Populates the child array of each element and make only a single instance of that particular block (Uses FindAll).
            This should still be array of blocks and not more forwards.
        GetChildren:
            Finds all of the children of a particular block and return all of them inside of a array.
        FindOne (Folder Oriented):
            Find a single instance of a block element
        MakeTree:
            Create a FTree from an array of blocks (Uses FindOne).
        FinalStruct:
            Takes the FTree and makes that tree into a File strucutre at the location of the root.

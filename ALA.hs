    Programming Languages Final Projec: ALA Compiler

    Description:
        ALA is an environment protocol language that will be able to produce a file system environment based 
        on the specification given from an end user. Typically, interactions will involve a user creating a file 
        following the general syntax of the ALA programming language, placing the .ala file as an argument to the 
        compilerâ€™s executable file (./ala), and pressing enter to allow the program to execute. After execution, 
        the program will either return an error showing where a conversion or system error occurred, or it will 
        return an environment within the user's linux system.

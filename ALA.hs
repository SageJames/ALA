    Programming Languages Final Projec: ALA Compiler

    Description:
        ALA is an environment protocol language that will be able to produce a file system environment based 
        on the specification given from an end user. Typically, interactions will involve a user creating a file 
        following the general syntax of the ALA programming language, placing the .ala file as an argument to the 
        compilerâ€™s executable file (./ala), and pressing enter to allow the program to execute. After execution, 
        the program will either return an error showing where a conversion or system error occurred, or it will 
        return an environment within the user's linux system.

    Description:
        This section holds all of the factors that contribute to the other two following sections being successful.

                This is where all of the root elements are located 
                (String of the root and if there can be an overwrite).
            Protocol Portion:
                The elements that make up an individual Protocol 
                (Name, Priority, Passing calls, and a compact individual instance).
            Block Portion:
                All of the types that are used for the different types of blocks

{-
    Description:
        This section houses all of the functions that contribute to 
        the main conversion of the strings to all the data structures 
        that are used within this project.

    Subsection:
       		Lexer:
           		This function converts a string to an array of tokens.
       		MakeBlocks:
                Converts an array of tokens into an array of blocks and forwards. 
                ([Block] Forward (->)).
       		FindAll (Folder Oriented):
                Take a block, array of blocks, and return an array of all the instances. 
                (Big helper method)
       		DetermineRoot:
                Look for the single instance of Root (Uses FindAll) 
                and set it to the Root term for the entire program.
      		PopulateChildren:
                Populates the child array of each element and makes 
                only a single instance of that particular block 
                (Uses FindAll).
           		This should still be an array of blocks and not more forwards.
       		GetChildren:
          		Mutates a block with all of its children.
       		ModElement:
           		Add a single child to a element
       		FindPointF (Folder Oriented):
           		Find a single instance folder and add it to an element.
       		GetallFolder:
           		Gather all folder instances in an array.
      		GetallFiles:
           		Gather all file instances in an array.
       		Endpoints:
           		Finds all of the empty folders and files.
       		StringPathAll:
           		Go through all endpoints to make an array of Filepaths.
       		StringPath:
           		Build a Filepaths from a single block.
      		StringPathBlocks:
                Takes a Child block, root array of Blocks, a stack of Blocks, 
                and adds all the elements to a stack until the root is found.
       		FindParent:
           		Gets the parent of a particular block.
       		CompareBlock:
           		Compare a particular Block to another.
       		GetChildrenArr:
           		Get a Child array of any Block with an element.
       		GetChildIns:
           		Convert a Block to a Child instance.
       		GetVar:
           		Get the variable instance of a Block.
       		GetName:
           		Get the name instance of a Block.
       		WriteString:
                Takes a Stack and an empty string and makes a Filepath instance.
